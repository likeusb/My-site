And in this case, you get to choose if you want speed or endurance. Everyone's approach will be different, yet everyone accomplishes the same task!</td>

        <td>Swimming is an excellent exercise! It uses all of your muscles and happens to also improve stamina and endurance! Make sure to not overwork yourself as it can get really exhausting, but by now the water is warm and you'll have a fun time enjoying a break from the summer heat in the nice, cold water.</td>
