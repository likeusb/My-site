        <p>
            Before I begin, I'd like to tell you that this review is based on 7 categories: Audio quality, Features, Battery life, Convenience, Reliability, Comfort, and Price.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will preface this review by stating that I have exclusively used Xiaomi Group products in tech, so I might have a bias in favor of Xiaomi, although I try my best to avoid it.
        </p>
        <h2>Audio Quality</h2>
        <p>
            In terms of audio quality, I am NOT an expert, nor am I an audiophile, so I cannot state objective facts. Audio quality also varies from person to person. Some prefer realistic voices, some prefer massive bass. But if I had to share what I think of it, it is really good. I don’t have any problems with it, and sometimes I actually prefer it to my phone speakers. Though this might be due to my outdated phone. Audio options also include AAC; however, I did not notice a major difference between AAC on and off.
        </p>
        <p>
            So overall, rating it out of 7, I give it a 5.5/7, since it is not something you would want to downgrade to if you are an audiophile. For regular users, it’s perfectly fine.
        </p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            I refer to ANC, Range, Touch options, etc., as features, so let’s discuss those.
        </p>
        <p>
            ANC is amazing. It can suppress up to 35 dB of audio, but I do not care about numbers; I talk practical usage. I can, rather reliably, tune out the audio of cars passing by right next to me at high speeds without problems or audio quality loss. I can also avoid listening to my classmates talking over one another if I want to relax.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall rating: 6/7. Sometimes it’s not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transparency mode is also present, though it is only really useful if you are talking to someone and don’t want to take out your earphones. It has a mode that automatically removes wind or other constant loud noises, since it tends to get annoying. However, this comes with the adverse effect of becoming useless outside, since it just cuts the transparency mode altogether due to wind. This is why I advise using one earphone at a time if you intend to talk to someone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I rate it 3/7. It’s not that useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Range is amazing. I can reliably put my phone down on one part of the garden, walk to the other side of my house, at least 10-15 meters away, and still keep listening to my music. It also covers my entire house from my upstairs bedroom desk, so I can just put my phone on the table while I go to get some drink, and I can maintain the connection, which my (now 3-year-old) previous headset couldn’t achieve with a Wi-Fi 2.4 connection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I rate it a great 6.5/7, since it does sometimes lose connection at distances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buttons & Controls are not ideal. They aren’t that responsive sometimes, and they have a delay. I prefer using my fitness tracker for audio control and my phone for track & audio control. My old Xiaomi Earphones 2S were far better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I rate it 3/7; they are just not good outside of ending a call or accepting a call.
        </p>
        <p>
            Convenience
        </p>
        <p>
            It's convenient. Wireless is just better compared to wired. I said it. It’s very nice, and these earphones follow the trend. They are very convenient, and the pairing is nearly instant. There’s not much more I can say about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall rating: 6/7; sometimes it does take some time to pair.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reliability
        </p>
        <p>
            In the almost half-year that I have had with these earphones, they have failed very few times. All but one of those were repaired on my own with a simple restart. Once the case broke and didn’t charge, but warranty took care of that, and a replacement came in a week. Still, it’s not perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall rating: 6/7.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="Warning">[CORRECTION]</span>, after 1.5 years of use, if not more, they did break on me numerous times requiring multiple trips to the Mi Store for warranty. I am now using the <a href="Redmi-Buds-5-Pro.html">Redmi Buds 5 Pro</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Comfort</h2>
        <p>
            Comfortable is an understatement. These are very comfortable and almost never fall out. I sometimes forget they are even in my ear since they are nearly weightless, but you do feel if they fall out, which they do not. I’ve ridden bikes across some rather bumpy surfaces at high speed with these, and they did not fall out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall rating: 7/7.
        </p>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>
            This is arguably the most important consideration. All that praise and all the good come at a price. To some, this one is rather extreme, to some, this is tiny. But if you have already looked at the product, you know how much it costs. €56.99. It’s not a huge price in terms of earphones, but to people who are in my situation, it’s expensive. I got here over time, exchanging my old Xiaomi Earphones 2S and getting these on sale for €44.99, but they are still at a really good price. The value is certainly good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall rating: 7/7.
        </p>
        <p>
            Average score: 5.7/7. Recommended? Yes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the review is done! This was 1002 words to describe one product. And it likely was severely inaccurate since I don’t have experience with great products. I hope you enjoyed this and found it useful!
