        <ul>
            <li>Suction power</li>
            <li>Battery life</li>
            <li>Build quality</li>
            <li>Pricing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Suction power</h2>
        <p>
            Every measure of how powerful a vacuum is is just straight up awful. There is no universal measurement and some use kPa, some use AW, some use some other garbage. The conversions don't exist and it's a mess so I'll just use normal, human terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's good.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's enough to clean out a carpet quite well, too. Compared to my other vacuum, a parkside dry vacuum that weighs half a ton and is very loud, it performs similarly on carpet and a little worse on regular floor. Still, good enough for daily, non intensive use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just don't vacuum water with it otherwise it might be ruined.
        </p>
        <h2>Battery life</h2>
        <p>
            Battery life is great!<br>
            45 minutes on regular mode (which is what I use most of the time) is more than enough to get my entire 2 floor many room house cleaned in one go and it's a huge convenience since whenever I want to vacuum, I just pick it up from the charging station, pick up the nozzles I'll need (usually the corner one works best) and go to vacuuming. 
            The one downside is 5 hours to charge 0-100 & no replacable batteries.
        </p>
        <h2>Build quality</h2>
        <p>
            This is where the first problem occurs. I don't know why, but the build quality is good (very repairable), but the tolerances on the connectors are AWFUL. Though, outside of this problem (That I rarely see anyways), it's quite good.
        </p>
        <h2>Price</h2>
        <p>
            Finally, the price.<br>
            It's 110€ and I got it for sale for just 80€.<br>
            I paid an extra 16€ after a year to replace the HEPA filter and will do so bi-annually for 16€/year (2 pack).
        </p>
        <h2>Overall ratings & recommendation:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Suction power: 4/5</li>
