        <p>To most, that did not make any sense. So the following will be a sort of explanation.</p>
        <p>
            <b><i>Fast lens</i></b> - A lens that has a low aperture number (F1.2, F2.8, etc.), as opposed to the usual F4.0-F8.0 apertures lenses have.<br><br>
            <b><i>Short Telephoto</i></b> - A lens that covers the 70-135mm Full Frame Equivalent focal length, mostly used for portraits and relatively close objects<br><br>            
            <b><i>Telephoto</i></b> - A lens that covers the 135-300mm Full Frame Equivalent focal length, used to take photos of faraway objects.<br><br>            
            <b><i>Super Telephoto</i></b> - A lens that has a >300mm Full Frame Equivalent focal length, used to take photos of small objects at great distances.<br><br>            
            <b><i>Wide-angle</i></b> - A lens that covers the 24-70mm Full Frame Equivalent focal length, used for wide field of view photos or portraits.<br><br>            
            <b><i>Fisheye</i></b> - A lens that is &lt20mm Full Frame Equivalent and usually gives a Fisheye effect, where the distortion is quite strong.<br><br>            
            <b><i>Full Frame Equivalent</i></b> - Every lens has a mm focal length, but not all sensors are built the same. APS-C, for example, is the mm focal length * 1.6 (Depends on the brand, for example, Sony has 1.5x crop, look up your own brand’s APS-C) for the FF Equivalent focal length. M4/3rds is mm * 2 for FF equivalent.</p>
            <h2>With that done, let’s talk lenses.</h2>            
            <p>The first main consideration is your budget and what you want to take photos of. The budget determines a lot of the features of your lens. Generally, lenses &lt500€ won’t have the best features with the best Autofocus and they won’t have crazy low apertures. Also, if you take photos of planes, you won’t be buying a fisheye, you’ll want a super telephoto. Another consideration is your mount. If you plan on buying a lens, KNOW WHAT MOUNT IT IS. Don’t buy a Canon RF lens for a low end Nikon.</p>
            <h2>So, what are your options?</h2>
            <p>Generally, my advice is take photos with the kit lens then go from there. If you find yourself enjoying nature and wildlife, but your kit lens can’t zoom that far, start with a basic telephoto, then move up to a super telephoto if the need is there. <br><br>            
            If you need to take photos in lowlight situations, go for a fast lens, like an F1.2 or F2.8. &ltF2 apertures are generally only available for primes, whereas the F2.8 aperture is common for the professional 24-70 lens, present on most camera ecosystems.<br><br>            
            If you find yourself taking photos of people, the fast lenses also have a great bonus - their low aperture results in an excellent Depth of Field. <br><br>            
            If you take photos of architecture, get a tilt shift. <br><br>            
            Another thing that matters a lot is the quality of the lens. More specifically, the glass. Canon L series lenses will be so much better than Canon EF-S kit lenses, because they are of much higher quality.</p>
